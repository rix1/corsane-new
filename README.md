This repository contains the front-end code for Corsane's new direction. 

### Install Dependencies

Through pagacke.json `npm` is preconfigured to automatically run `bower` so we can simply do:

```
npm install
```

Behind the scenes this will also call `bower install`.  You should find that you have two new
folders in your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need
* `app/bower_components` - contains the angular framework files

*Note that the `bower_components` folder would normally be installed in the root folder, but this is changed through the `.bowerrc` file. Doing so makes it easier to serve the files by a webserver like nginx.*

### Example config

Create file ```/app/config.js``` and add the following

```
angular
    .module('myApp.config', [])
    .constant('config', {
        baseUrl: 'http://your-api.com/'
    });
```

### Run the Application

Because this project uses the [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) CSS pre-processor, we need to compile the style.less file. Do this by typing (from root directory):

```
lessc --no-color app/styles/style.less > app/styles/style.css
```

LESS is a prerequsite here, and can be installed with `npm install -g less`. The project is preconfigured with a simple development web server. Serve the application with the following command:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:8000/app/`.
